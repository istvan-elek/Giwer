Giwer (GeoImage Workflow Editing Resources) is a program pack, which consists of many image processing functions, tools and gatgets. You can use it interactively, or in batch mode, when you can assemble any combination of functions to one workflow before, then apply to the certain image. Soon the desktop version will be available, but currently it is under development yet. Tif, jpg and bil files are supported, but the working format is the so called gwr format, which is an own, binary format. This format serves fast running. Not only the traditional image processing methods were implemented but many mathematical statistical methods will also be available to interpret the image content.
